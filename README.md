### Purpose
A simple WebTorrent client made with React and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

The purpose is to test file transfer capabilities and highlight possible transfer rate differences with different versions of the WebTorrent project.

### Magnet links
The app uses magnet links to initiate transfers: .torrent files are not supported.

### Usage
`yarn dev` to start the development server.

#### Download
Paste in a magnet link and click 'Start download'.

#### Seeding
Select one or more files to start seeding. Copy the magnet link and share it with a WebTorrent client to initiate transfer.
